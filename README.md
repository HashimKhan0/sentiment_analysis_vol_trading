# sentiment_analysis_vol_trading
contains current state of my understanding on how to use a machine learning concept to trade vol
i wish to document and explore the usage of any number of ML models to trade volatility.
while the end goal is to gain an edge, this topic also allows me to explore various interests.

### some skills that i beleive would be beneficial to retain long term that are displayed in this project:
    - web scraping for ML purposes
    - 



### my current problem set can be expaneded into the following two subsets:
    - Financial-ish
        - what set of financial instruments do i wish to work on? will i use multiple types? 
        - choosing a media source that allows me to webscrape with minimal extra input
        - do i choose a market neutral strategy? bullish / bearish regime switching?
    - Code/ML
        - do i webscrape like a noob?
        - do i classify or predict a probability? **probability seems like a good way to judge risk but the dataset now becomes a hassel**
        - how do i live trade / host this?
        - backtesting the machine learning component **seems** easy but how do i determine my results are indicative of my strategy working and not chance/ black box magic?
        - wut model?
